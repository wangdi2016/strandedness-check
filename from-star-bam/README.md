Use two house keeping genes:  GAPDH and ACTB

GAPDH is on the forward strand, chr12:6534517-6538371

ACTB is on the reverse strand, chr7:5527152-5563902

Both indicate the data is strand-specific forward.

## Note:

CGR uses IDT xgen adapters which flipps the read1 and read2, although it uses dUTP for the second strand.
