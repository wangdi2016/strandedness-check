This is PairEnd Data
Fraction of reads failed to determine: 0.1498
Fraction of reads explained by "1++,1--,2+-,2-+": 0.0104 (1.2% of explainable reads)
Fraction of reads explained by "1+-,1-+,2++,2--": 0.8397 (98.8% of explainable reads)
== Over 90% of reads explained by "1+-,1-+,2++,2--"
== Data is likely RF/fr-firststrand or reverse-stranded
